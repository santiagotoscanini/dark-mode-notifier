## MacOS

This is a Swift script that listens to the `AppleInterfaceThemeChangedNotification` event and invokes `/Users/stoscanini/dev/personal/dotfiles/dark-mode-notifier/change-theme.zsh` with the env var `DARKMODE` set.

Heavily inspired by [dark-mode-notify](https://github.com/bouk/dark-mode-notify)
